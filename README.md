## Get Started

Head to our [quick-start guide][quick-start] to learn how Hypedrive works and how can you integrate it in your applications.



## Versioning

This library uses semantic versioning. Our goal is to keep the API as stable as possible without introducing any breaking changes, so that new features can be used even in older projects by updating the framework.

We don't officially support anything but the latest available version. An exception to this rule are paying customers who receive an extended support as well as one-off patches.

Reactant is a foundation for rapid and safe iOS development. It allows you to cut down your development costs by improving reusability, testability and safety of your code, especially your UI. Check our our [quick-start guide][quick-start] to learn more.

## Requirements

* iOS 9.0+

## Versioning
This library uses semantic versioning. We won't introduce any breaking changes without releasing a new major version. Our main goal is to keep the API as stable as possible. We build our applications on top of Reactant as well and we absolutely hate any breaking changes.
